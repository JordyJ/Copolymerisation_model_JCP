This repo contains the code and data required to run and reproduce the results published in https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article/156/7/074103/2840795/Minimal-mechanism-for-cyclic-templating-of-length .
The model is a stochastic monte-carlo simulation (Gillespie Algorithm) of a templated copolymerisation process on a single linear template molecule. The simulation is written in C++ and analysis is performed in Python.

# Description of contents.

The directories are organised as follows. 
0 contains instructions on how to compile and run a single simulation from a single input file input.csv .
1 contains a script for running multiple simulations from an input file table called inputlist.csv .
2-8 Contain the input files and averaged data (e.g. mean polymer length averaged over n independent repeats). 
Helper code contains a python script used to turn the text-based conformations generated by the model into nice pdfs.
